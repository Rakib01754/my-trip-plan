                <p>
                    My name is Md Rakibul Hasan. I’m a Web Developer and voracious reader who takes solo trips around the country. So far, I have been to 15 districts and have many more trips planned. As a person, exploring is what I do best. Did I mention I’m terrified of flying? I might have picked the wrong hobby! But I’m living proof that you can follow your dreams even if they happen to scare you.
